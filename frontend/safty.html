     <p id="advantage_dec">With safety being the top priority for every individual, it gets riskier to use public transport at the moment with so many concerns regarding the hygiene and safety of such transportation. At the same time social distancing is becoming our number one practise which makes it even more difficult to use any kind of transport. Two wheelers being the most safest for commuting at this point, ONN Bikes is taking every measure to make two wheelers available to the public in a safe manner.</p>
